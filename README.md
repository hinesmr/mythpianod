Listen to Pandora in MythTV

Pandora changes it's protocol like the wind, so it's impossible to embed
it's playback functionality directly into MythTV without recompiling constantly.

Instead, this plugin (heavily based on MythPandora), 
uses Pianod (http://deviousfish.com/pianod/) as a service
by sending commands to Pianod.

You must have a Pianod server up and running in order for this plugin
to work.
